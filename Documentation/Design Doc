Game Design Document

My game will be a 3D platformer shooter where you will be able to shoot, move, jump and do various other movement abilities I may add to the game. The game will be a single player 3D first person game.

This game will be available on PC and developed on unity with the c# coding language.

The gameplay will consist of platforming while trying to survive or take out different sorts of enemies. You will be able to progress through layers by reaching a specific point on the map.

The player will move using the basic FPS controls (WASD to move and space to jump) and I will also attempt to add more advanced forms of movement such as sliding. I will also add a shooting mechanic using the left mouse button to activate.

I will also attempt to add power ups to my game which will give the player boosts such as speed boosts or jump boosts.

2024 Assessment Task 3:

For this assignment I added a database to my previous project using firebase

The database is able to store authentication for multiple accounts including an email, a password a unique UserId and time values

The database will change the time values if a faster time is received, saving highscores for all players.
